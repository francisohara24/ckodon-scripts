# ckodon-bootcamp-analysis-2
Data analysis project I worked on to organize a new cohort of students at [the Ckodon Foundation](https://www.ckodon.com/foundation) for a bootcamp.

### Goals
 - Import student data collected via Google Forms and clean the data.
 - Randomly assign a group to each student that filled the form.
 - Send each student an email with their assigned group and a link to join a WhatsApp group created specifically for their assigned group.
